# ChaCha20

This is a very simple and na√Øve implementation of Daniel J. Bernstein's [ChaCha20 stream cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20#ChaCha_variant) in plain C.

**Do not use this in production.** This is merely an experiment and you should probably not be using it anywhere.

The test vectors were sourced from [Monocypher](https://github.com/LoupVaillant/Monocypher/blob/3.1.1/tests/gen/vectors/chacha20).
